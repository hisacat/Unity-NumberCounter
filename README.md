## Font Texture Example

Below is an example of a font texture. (The actual background should be transparent.)  
![Font example](./Images/Font.png)  
You can create and use custom font textures as well. A [Font Template.psd](./Assets/HisaCat/NumberCounter/FontTemplate.psd) file is provided to help you get started.

## Usage

- Refer to the `Assets/HisaCat/Number Counter/Sample Scene` for examples.  
  To use, simply apply materials with shaders like `HisaCat/Number Counter Unlit Cutout` or `HisaCat/Number Counter Unlit Alpha Blended` to a Quad mesh.
- Properties:  
  ![Properties](./Images/Inspector-Properties.png)
  - `Color`: The final color to be multiplied.
  - `Sprite Sheet`: A texture containing digits 0‚Äì9 (5 Columns 2 Rows).
  - `Display Length`: Number of digits to display.
  - `Value`: The value to display.
  - `Align`: Alignment of the displayed value.
    - `Fill Zeros`: Right-align with empty spaces filled with `0`.
    - `Left`: Left-aligns the number.
    - `Right`: Right-aligns the number.

## Additional Information

This shader is manually coded and optimized for performance.  
The core logic is located in [NumberCounter.cginc](./Assets/HisaCat/NumberCounter/Shaders/NumberCounter.cginc) if you‚Äôre interested in exploring the code.

Since this shader excludes certain padding areas around the edges, enabling the texture‚Äôs `Mipmaps` option won‚Äôt cause visual artifacts, which makes it compatible with games like VRChat.
